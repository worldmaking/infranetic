I made agents 'die' if their reward is < 0.1, 
and be reborn by copying another agent somewhere

I disabled restoring the 'marks' array (data[3]) because it was expensive
but still having the agents make marks (by setting data[3] = 0)

what happens is that the population gradually recedes to a small area... 

That is, if the agents remove the resources, the areas quickly go dark. Maybe this is one way to apply the immune system?

label
birthregion_time_countsofchangeinregion_currentregion
- prefix name with region codes (natural, cultural, industrial as N, C, I etc.)
- remove year from date
- remove space (underbar or none)
- monospace font
- greyer (or more transparent)
- align left

Initialize agents by region, with on/off genes, controlling behaviour style, speed, maybe threshold etc?

Balance between +ve and -ve feedback
- make 10% non-homeostatic, 
- not sure yet what to apply this to

Currently share network & color
- e.g. share 'fake news', share a lie, or something... or share 'urge to mutate'
- or also share resources (and need to maintain a minimum?)

Missing surveillance

make children size/speed different?


according to info, 1 or 2 regions trigger abnormal reaction such as direction bias, change of direction of pursuing, more dramatic speed/lifespan change
- make this more visible e.g. smearing, bigger vibration (local quake)
- passing effect, or requires observer to rebalance
