rendering: 
- make gwangju visible
- make sync visible

splatting to a context2d makes no difference. 
switching to a 1920x1080 canvas (and gl-rendering at that resolution) makes no difference
using a slightly better sampler kernel in slab_composite helped a little

could point sprites help?

OK so our composite needs to be able to balance the appearance of these things:
- the long-term trails left by agents
- the immediate pulsing of agents
- the sporadic connections of agents
- any bleeding spread of the agents

now separated into different fbos so we can tune more easily:
- basic fbo captures agents & lines
- syncfbo captures short term, to emphasize pulsing (add blur?)
- trailsfbo does long-term feedback

slab_composite takes care of blending them.

if we captured the new agents data into a separate fbo, those could feed into 




show data graph
- maybe history, replacing 1 box every day or so with a summary

watchers now can switch to more interesting neighbours .. but what is the measure of interesting?
- if they are all too similar, maybe this is the watcher's frustration trigger?

I made agents 'die' if their reward is < 0.1, 
and be reborn by copying another agent somewhere

I disabled restoring the 'marks' array (data[3]) because it was expensive
but still having the agents make marks (by setting data[3] = 0)

what happens is that the population gradually recedes to a small area... 

That is, if the agents remove the resources, the areas quickly go dark. Maybe this is one way to apply the immune system?

improve: rendering quality

Initialize agents by region, with on/off genes, controlling behaviour style, speed, maybe threshold etc?

Balance between +ve and -ve feedback
- make 10% non-homeostatic, 
- not sure yet what to apply this to

Currently share network & color
- e.g. share 'fake news', share a lie, or something... or share 'urge to mutate'
- or also share resources (and need to maintain a minimum?)

complete surveillance

make children size/speed different?

according to info, 1 or 2 regions trigger abnormal reaction such as direction bias, change of direction of pursuing, more dramatic speed/lifespan change
- make this more visible e.g. smearing, bigger vibration (local quake)
- passing effect, or requires observer to rebalance

Slime or 2d metaball shading, or reaction diffusion shading
