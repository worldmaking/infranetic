I made agents 'die' if their reward is < 0.1, 
and be reborn by copying another agent somewhere

I disabled restoring the 'marks' array (data[3]) because it was expensive
but still having the agents make marks (by setting data[3] = 0)

what happens is that the population gradually recedes to a small area... 

That is, if the agents remove the resources, the areas quickly go dark. Maybe this is one way to apply the immune system?
